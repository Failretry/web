		<h1 style="margin-bottom:2px;">\\\ A BIT MORE INFO AS TO WHAT'S GOING ON</h1>
		<p style="color: #fc9d49; margin-top:2px; margin-bottom: 0px;">6/20/21<p>
		<p style="margin-top: 2px;">Hello again. Welcome back to the newest little corner I’m trying to carve out on the internet. I wanted to talk about what I want to do here and what maybe you can expect from here. 
		I also wanted to touch on some of my inspirations and history that led to making this site. Okay so first off this is going to be a blog type thing. 
		Yeah, I know those have fallen out of favor now and the last time they were cool was 2009. Here’s the thing, I have found myself very dissatisfied with the modern way that the internet 
		works, and I want to try and do something different, something far more in line with the way the internet worked a decade or more ago. These centralized companies that are selling and 
		recording vast amounts of data and information are not places I frequent much anymore, and not environments that I want to be a part of. So, here’s what I’m doing instead, building a 
		website from the ground up just about the things I like, electronics, engineering, radio, photography, technology, cities, video games, and smooth jazz Weather Channel music from 20 
		years ago (what I’m listening to as I’m writing this). It’s going to stay anonymous, but I do want to have interaction with this community, if anyone is at all interested in this, so 
		there’s a Discord server, and I may set up an IRC integration with that, I figured that Discord wasn’t a bad idea, and it’s pretty much a newer version of IRC anyway. Lemme know what you 
		think, and I hope to add a few more basic features to the site sometime soon, but I may not actively update this super often, and may take long breaks form here. That’s part of the nice 
		thing about doing this site this way is that I don’t feel like I have to post or upload something to maintain relevance with an almighty algorithm. I know that I’m irrelevant and can’t be 
		monetized, and well, I don’t really care tbh. If I do manage to make YouTube videos or some other sort of content, it’s not to make money, it’s just because I wanted to. Anyway that’s it 
		for now, I am working on the SDR cyberdeck, but the battery I bought doesn’t actually maintain 5V at 2.5ish A which really sucks and I don’t know how to fix that yet, so uh yeah, maybe 
		I’ll get that fixed. See ya on the World Wide Superinformationhighway, cheese curds.  </p>

		<p style="margin-top: 5px;">Welcome to Failretry_. Unsure what'll exactly go here just yet, but expect things connected to building digital devices and whatnot. 
		The first project I'm working on is a cyberdeck designed for listening to and decoding digital signals over RF using an SDR. 
		I hope to post what I'm working on here, and I may start making YouTube videos showcasing some of the projects I’ve worked on sometime soon.
